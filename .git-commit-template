#[type](scope) subject

# --- COMMIT END ---
# Type can be
#    feat  (new feature)
#    fix   (bug fix)
#    refac (refactoring production code)
#    style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#    docs  (changes to documentation)
#    test  (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
#    chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
# --------------------
# Remember to
#    Capitalize the subject line
#    Scope is a rough word embracing changed parts
#    Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    Do not end the subject line with a period
#    Separate subject from body with a blank line
#    Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#    Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
